Arrays are data structures stored in contiguous memory locations

[0, 1, 2.... n-1] -> Arrays of String, Integer, Map .. and so on

Brute -> Better -> Optimal [Solution approach]

Max elements that can be stored -> 10^6 [if declared inside Main]
                                   else 10^7 [if declared globally]
